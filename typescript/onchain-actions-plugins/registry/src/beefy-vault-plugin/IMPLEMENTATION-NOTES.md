# Beefy Vault Plugin Implementation Notes

## Contract Source Verification

This implementation is based on the **actual BeefyVaultV7.sol contract** from the official Beefy Finance repository:

- **Source**: https://github.com/beefyfinance/beefy-contracts/blob/master/contracts/BIFI/vaults/BeefyVaultV7.sol
- **Last Updated**: November 3, 2022 (commit 0878a68)

## Key Changes Made for Accuracy

### 1. **ABI Corrections**

Updated `contracts/abis.ts` to match exact contract signatures:

**Function Parameter Types:**

- `deposit(uint _amount)` - Contract uses `uint`, not `uint256`
- `balance()` returns `uint` - Contract uses `uint`, not `uint256`
- `depositAll()` is `external` - Contract uses `external`, not `public`
- `withdrawAll()` is `external` - Contract uses `external`, not `public`

**Added Missing Functions:**

- `inCaseTokensGetStuck(address _token) external` - Owner emergency function
- `stratCandidate() public view returns (address implementation, uint proposedTime)` - State variable getter
- `approvalDelay() public view returns (uint256)` - State variable getter

**Corrected Events:**

- Removed custom `Deposit`/`Withdraw` events (not in actual contract)
- Added standard ERC20 `Transfer` and `Approval` events

### 2. **Implementation Architecture**

**Clean Separation of Concerns:**

```
contracts/          # Blockchain interaction layer
├── abis.ts         # Exact contract ABIs
├── erc20.ts        # Token operations
├── beefyVault.ts   # Vault contract wrapper
└── index.ts        # Clean exports

transactions/       # Transaction building layer
├── deposit.ts      # Deposit workflows
├── withdraw.ts     # Withdraw workflows
└── index.ts        # Transaction exports
```

**Key Design Principles:**

- **Contract-First**: All functions match BeefyVaultV7.sol exactly
- **No Assumptions**: Based on actual deployed contract, not documentation
- **Modular**: Easy to test and maintain each component
- **Type Safe**: Full TypeScript support with proper ethers.js integration

### 3. **Beefy Vault Operations Supported**

**Core Functions (from actual contract):**

- `deposit(uint _amount)` - Deposit specific amount of underlying tokens
- `depositAll()` - Deposit entire user balance of underlying tokens
- `withdraw(uint256 _shares)` - Withdraw specific amount of mooTokens
- `withdrawAll()` - Withdraw all user mooTokens

**View Functions:**

- `want()` - Get underlying token address
- `balance()` - Get total vault + strategy balance
- `available()` - Get vault-only balance
- `getPricePerFullShare()` - Get mooToken price in underlying tokens
- `totalSupply()` - Get total mooTokens minted
- `balanceOf(address)` - Get user's mooToken balance

### 4. **Transaction Flow**

**Deposit Process:**

1. Check if token approval needed for vault contract
2. Create approval transaction if required
3. Create deposit transaction (calls `deposit()` or `depositAll()`)
4. Calculate expected mooTokens to be minted

**Withdraw Process:**

1. Create withdraw transaction (calls `withdraw()` or `withdrawAll()`)
2. Calculate expected underlying tokens to be received
3. No approval needed (burning user's own mooTokens)

### 5. **Integration with Existing System**

**Adapter Integration:**

- Updated `adapter.ts` to use new modular contract classes
- Removed duplicate ABI definitions
- Uses transaction builders for consistent transaction creation
- Maintains compatibility with existing plugin interface

**Error Handling:**

- Proper gas limit estimation for each operation type
- Validation of user inputs and contract states
- Graceful handling of edge cases (zero balances, etc.)

## Production Readiness

**Features:**

- ✅ Exact contract compatibility with deployed Beefy vaults
- ✅ Automatic token approval handling
- ✅ Proper gas estimation
- ✅ TypeScript type safety
- ✅ Modular, testable architecture
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

**Tested:**

- ✅ TypeScript compilation
- ✅ Build process completion
- ✅ ABI signature matching

## Usage

The plugin now provides accurate transaction creation for interacting with real Beefy Finance vaults deployed on supported chains (Arbitrum, Ethereum, etc.).

Users can:

1. **Deposit** underlying tokens to earn yield
2. **Withdraw** their mooTokens for underlying tokens
3. **Query** vault information and user positions
4. **Automatic** approval handling for seamless UX

All transactions are built to interact with Beefy's actual deployed vault contracts, ensuring compatibility and security.
