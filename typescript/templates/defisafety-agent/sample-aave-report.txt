5. Q5: Has the protocol thoroughly tested its smart contract code?
   Weight: 15%
   Score: 90%
   Weighted Contribution: 13.5 points

   Analysis: Aave demonstrates extensive testing with comprehensive test suites visible in their GitHub repository. The protocol includes unit tests, integration tests, and scenario tests. Test coverage appears to be very high based on the test files present.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

6. Q6: Is the bug bounty program value acceptably high?
   Weight: 15%
   Score: 90%
   Weighted Contribution: 13.5 points

   Analysis: Aave maintains an active bug bounty program with Immunefi offering rewards up to $250,000 for critical vulnerabilities. While substantial, this is below the $500k-$1M range for top-tier programs relative to Aave's TVL.

   Evidence:
   • [https://immunefi.com/bounty/aave/] Active Immunefi bug bounty program
   • [https://docs.aave.com/developers/security-and-audits#bug-bounty] Bug bounty mentioned in security documentation

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

7. Q7: Is the admin control documentation easy to find?
   Weight: 7%
   Score: 100%
   Weighted Contribution: 7.0 points

   Analysis: Aave clearly documents governance and admin controls in a dedicated governance section. The documentation explains the DAO structure, voting mechanisms, and admin capabilities in detail.

8. Q8: Are the contracts clearly labeled as upgradeable or immutable?
   Weight: 7%
   Score: 70%
   Weighted Contribution: 4.9 points

   Analysis: Aave documents that it uses proxy patterns for upgradeability, but the documentation could be clearer about which specific contracts are upgradeable vs immutable. The information exists but requires some searching.

   Evidence:
   • [https://docs.aave.com/developers/v/2.0/the-core-protocol/protocol-overview#upgradability] Mentions use of proxy pattern
   • [https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/contracts/protocol/configuration/PoolAddressesProvider.sol] Code shows upgradeable proxy implementation
   • [Technical Paper] References upgradeability mechanism

   Weight: 7%
   Score: 100%
   Weighted Contribution: 7.0 points

   Weight: 7%
   Score: 40%
   Weighted Contribution: 2.8 points

   Analysis: While Aave mentions that governance can modify parameters and upgrade contracts, the documentation lacks a comprehensive list of all changeable parameters and their limits. More detail on specific admin capabilities would improve transparency.

   Evidence:
   • [https://docs.aave.com/governance] General governance capabilities mentioned
   • [https://docs.aave.com/risk] Some risk parameters that can be changed are listed
   • [Documentation] Specific contract change capabilities not comprehensively documented

11. Q11: Is the protocol's use of an oracle sufficiently documented?
   Weight: 8%
   Score: 100%
   Weighted Contribution: 8.0 points

   Analysis: Aave thoroughly documents its use of Chainlink price oracles, including which feeds are used, how prices are calculated, and the update mechanisms. The oracle integration is clearly explained with technical details.
