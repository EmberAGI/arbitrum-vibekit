Q1: Are the deployed smart contract addresses easy to find in the documentation?
Weight: 15%

Purpose: Verify that the protocol's documentation clearly lists the addresses of the deployed smart contracts (not just the token address, but the core contracts like pools, vaults, farms, etc.). This is crucial so that users and reviewers can quickly find and verify the running contracts on a block explorer. If contract addresses are not provided, it undermines transparency and even affects audit verifiability (any audit cannot be matched to deployed code if addresses are unknown).

Where to Look: Check the project's documentation pages (or GitHub README) for a section titled "Contracts", "Deployed Addresses", "Smart Contracts", or similar. Often, well-documented projects have a dedicated page listing all important contract names and their addresses on each network. If no obvious section, use the search function in docs for known address formats (like "0x" which starts Ethereum addresses) or terms like "contract address".

Scoring Criteria: According to DeFiSafety guidelines, evaluate how readily the addresses can be found:

    100% (Full marks): The documentation prominently and clearly lists the contract addresses (e.g. in a dedicated "Smart Contracts" section or similar) on the official site or docs, such that they are immediately visible and labeled without any deep searching. For example, a page that explicitly enumerates each core contract and its address would qualify.

    70%: The addresses are present in the docs but not very obvious – you might need to navigate a bit or use search within the documentation to find them. Perhaps they are mentioned under another section (like buried in a FAQ or a developer guide) rather than a central list.

    40%: The addresses were found only after significant effort or in an obscure place – for instance, hidden in a JSON file (like a mainnet.json in the code repository), in an audit report, or an answer on a community Discord/forum. This means the info is public but not in the official docs in an obvious way.

    20%: An address was found incidentally but not clearly labeled or not easy to identify as the main contracts. For example, maybe a single contract address is mentioned in passing, or it's unclear which contracts it refers to.

    0%: No contract addresses are found in any public documentation. This is a failing condition – the protocol does not disclose what/where its smart contracts are, which is a serious transparency issue. (If this happens, note that the security audit question would also score 0% because one cannot verify the audited code against deployed code.)

Answer Format: The answer should state whether the contract addresses are provided in the docs and how easy they were to locate, then give the resulting score. For example:

    "Yes – the documentation has a dedicated 'Contracts' page listing all the deployed contract addresses on Ethereum and Polygon, which was very easy to find. Therefore, the addresses are clearly accessible. Score: 100%."

If partial or not obvious:

    "Addresses are given, but only in a GitHub repository file and not in the main docs, which made them hard to find. Score: 40%."

If no addresses:

    "No – the documentation does not list any deployed contract addresses. Score: 0%."

Each statement should be backed by a citation from the documentation where the information (or lack thereof) was confirmed.
