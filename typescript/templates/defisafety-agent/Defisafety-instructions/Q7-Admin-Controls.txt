Q7: Is the admin control documentation easy to find?
Weight: 7%

Purpose: Ensure that information about the protocol's admin controls (powers that admins/governance have over the contracts) is readily accessible in the documentation. Admin controls info includes who can upgrade contracts, change parameters, pause the system, etc. It's vital that users can quickly find this, since it affects their investment risk. If the admin control details are buried or scattered, users might miss critical details like the ability for devs to halt the protocol or change fees.

Where to Look: Check the documentation for sections likely named "Admin Controls", "Governance", "Security", "Ownership", or "DAO". Often, projects put admin info under a governance section (if the protocol is governed by a DAO or multi-sig). If not immediately visible in a sidebar or index, search the docs for keywords: admin, upgrade, governance, ownership, permissions, keys. Also see if the whitepaper (Q3) or security page contains an admin powers description.

Scoring Criteria: The easier it is to find, the higher the score:

    100%: The admin controls info is prominently and clearly labeled in the docs, easy for a user to locate. Ideally, there's a top-level or clearly indicated section titled "Admin Controls" or a very obvious "Governance" page that one can't miss. Full points also if labeled as "DAO" or similar, as long as it contains the relevant info and is easy to navigate to.

    70%: The information is present and labeled, but not immediately obvious – perhaps under a less obvious section or requires some clicking around. For example, admin details might be under a "FAQ" or embedded in a general "About the Protocol" page where you have to scroll to find it.

    20%: The info exists but is in multiple pieces or poorly labeled. You might have to use the search function or piece together details from different pages (like something under "Tokenomics" and something under "Security" to get the full picture). It's not in one place and not clearly identified as admin info.

    0%: No information about admin controls can be found in the documentation. Users have no clear idea what admin powers exist, which is a major transparency issue.

Answer Format: Describe how/where the info was found and score:

    "The documentation has a dedicated 'Governance & Admin' section which is easy to find from the docs homepage. All admin powers are compiled there, so it's very accessible. Score: 100%."

    If somewhat hidden: "Details on admin controls are available but required some digging – they were under the 'Staking' and 'Security' sections rather than a standalone page. It was not immediately clear, though the info exists. Score: 70%."

    If not found: "No explicit documentation of admin controls was found (no sections on governance or admin powers in the docs). Score: 0%."

Include citations for where the admin info is (or a statement from docs that implies no such info). The answer should clearly convey how easy or hard a user would find it to locate this information.
