Scoring Categories:
- Smart Contracts & Repositories (Q1-Q2): 18%
- Code Documentation (Q3-Q4): 16%
- Testing (Q5): 15%
- Security (Q6): 15%
- Admin Controls (Q7-Q10): 28%
- Oracles (Q11): 8%

How to Calculate Overall Score:
1. Score each question individually (0-100%)
2. Multiply each question score by its weight
3. Sum all weighted scores for the final protocol score

Example Calculation:
If a protocol scores:
- Q1: 100% x 15% = 15 points
- Q2: 100% x 3% = 3 points
- Q3: 100% x 8% = 8 points
- Q4: 0% x 8% = 0 points
- Q5: 80% x 15% = 12 points
- Q6: 70% x 15% = 10.5 points
- Q7: 100% x 7% = 7 points
- Q8: 80% x 7% = 5.6 points
- Q9: 100% x 7% = 7 points
- Q10: 50% x 7% = 3.5 points
- Q11: 100% x 8% = 8 points

Total Score = 79.6%

Score Interpretation:
- 90-100%: Excellent - Very high transparency and security practices
- 70-89%: Good - Solid documentation and practices with minor gaps
- 50-69%: Fair - Some important documentation missing or practices lacking
- 30-49%: Poor - Major gaps in transparency and security practices
- 0-29%: Failing - Critical lack of documentation and transparency
