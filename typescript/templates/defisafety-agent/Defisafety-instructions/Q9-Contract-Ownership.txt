Q9: Is the type of contract ownership (e.g., OnlyOwner, multi-sig, DAO) clearly indicated?
Weight: 7%

Purpose: Determine if the documentation clearly states who/what controls the smart contracts, i.e., the ownership model. Common ownership setups are: an OnlyOwner (single admin key/address), a multisig wallet (multiple signatures required), or a DAO governance contract. This question checks if the docs highlight these details for each contract or overall – so users know if a single person can call admin functions or if it's controlled by a community, etc.. It's crucial because it relates to centralization risk.

Where to Look: Again, the Admin Controls section of documentation is the primary place. Look for descriptions of admin keys or governance. Keywords: owner, admin, multisig, multi-sig, onlyOwner, governance address, DAO. Often, a project will have a section describing "Admin Key" or "Governance" where they mention if ownership has been transferred to a multisig or a timelock + governance. Also check if the docs mention anything like "contract X is owned by a Gnosis Safe" or "Ownership of Y was renounced."

Scoring Criteria: From the guidelines:

    100%: The documentation clearly identifies the ownership of each deployed contract and the mechanism. For example, it explicitly states "Contract A is owned by a 3-of-5 multisig controlled by the team" or "governed by a DAO with token voting" or "admin keys have been burned/renounced". Essentially, a reader can easily tell who has the power on each contract.

    50%: The ownership info exists but only in the code or code comments, not in the docs. For instance, maybe the smart contracts are OpenZeppelin with OnlyOwner modifiers, and an audit report notes a multisig, but the docs themselves don't mention it. That yields partial credit – the info is not in user-facing docs.

    0%: Admin/ownership information is not found in documentation (and possibly not clearly discernible at all). Users have no idea if a single admin or a multisig or no one controls the contracts from reading the docs.

Answer Format:

    "Yes – the documentation specifies contract ownership. For example, it states that the core contracts are owned by a 4-of-6 multisig (Gnosis Safe) and enumerates the roles (there's also a timelock on changes). This clarity in indicating OnlyOwner vs multisig earns full marks. Score: 100%."

    If only in code: "The docs do not explicitly mention ownership or admin keys, but the smart contract code uses an OnlyOwner pattern and an Etherscan comment indicates a multisig is the owner. Since this isn't documented for users, it only scores partial. Score: 50%."

    If not at all: "No – the documentation does not reveal who controls the contracts (no mention of admin addresses or multisigs). Score: 0%."

Always try to cite documentation for the ownership info. If docs mention "we use a multisig wallet for upgrades" or "ownership has been transferred to governance," quote that. If nothing is in docs, you might cite an absence or an audit comment as indirect evidence, making it clear that the info wasn't in the provided docs.
