Q8: Are the contracts clearly labeled as upgradeable or immutable in the documentation?
Weight: 7%

Purpose: Check if the docs specify for each relevant smart contract whether it is upgradeable (can be changed after deployment via proxy or other mechanism) or immutable (cannot be changed once deployed). This is important because upgradeable contracts introduce additional trust requirements (you have to trust the admin not to upgrade to malicious code). Clear labeling of which contracts are upgradeable helps users understand the protocol's mutability. Full points require that the documentation explicitly states the status (upgradeable or not) of the contracts.

Where to Look: In the admin/governance or contract documentation sections. The Admin Controls or Security part of docs often mentions upgradeability. Look for keywords: upgradeable, proxy, immutable, upgradability. Also, sometimes auditors mention this in audit reports (though we prefer what the project documentation says). If multiple contracts exist, ideally the docs list each and say "Contract X is upgradeable via proxy / Contract Y is non-upgradeable."

Scoring Criteria: According to guidelines:

    100%: The documentation and even the code comments clearly state that all contracts are immutable (non-upgradeable). Basically, if they have made everything non-upgradeable and they highlight that fact for each contract, that's the best case (because immutable contracts are most secure and it's clearly communicated).

    80%: The documentation clearly labels the upgradeability status of every contract (upgradeable or not). This likely means some contracts might be upgradeable, but the docs explicitly say which ones and which ones aren't. So transparency is there for all contracts.

    50%: The contracts are actually immutable (not upgradeable) in code, but the documentation fails to mention this. In other words, the only way to know is by reading the code or audit – the docs didn't inform the user. This scores partial because the outcome (immutability) is good, but they didn't document it.

    0%: No information on upgradeability is provided. The user cannot tell from the docs which contracts can be changed. (Also if admin control info as a whole is missing, likely this is 0). It could also be that the protocol has upgradeable contracts but they are not labeled as such anywhere in docs.

Answer Format:

    If clearly labeled: "Yes – the documentation specifies upgradeability for each contract. For example, it states 'The Vault and Strategy contracts are upgradeable proxies, while the Token contract is immutable.' This transparent labeling meets the criteria. Score: 80%." (If all were immutable and stated, say 100%. If just labeled, 80%.)

    If only code reveals it: "The docs do not explicitly mention upgradeability, but an audit indicates the contracts are actually immutable. Since users wouldn't know from docs, this only gets partial credit. Score: 50%."

    If not mentioned at all: "No – the documentation does not indicate which contracts (if any) are upgradeable or immutable. Score: 0%."

Cite accordingly. If the docs say something like "All contracts are upgradeable via our proxy system" or "X contract is upgradeable," quote that. If relying on an audit or code for info, cite that (though prefer documentation statements). The answer should convey whether the project clearly communicates contract mutability to its users.
