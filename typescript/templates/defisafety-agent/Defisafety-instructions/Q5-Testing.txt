Q5: Has the protocol thoroughly tested its smart contract code, and what is the extent of testing?
Weight: 15%

Purpose: Determine if the project has a comprehensive test suite for its smart contracts and how extensive those tests are. This looks at both the presence of tests and their coverage relative to the code. A well-tested protocol will have many tests (unit tests for individual contracts and system tests for integration) and ideally a high Test-to-Code (TtC) ratio. Essentially, we want to see if virtually every part of the code is covered by tests, indicating rigor in the development process.

Where to Look: Check the project's public repository (from Q2) for a directory named "tests" or files ending in .spec or .test. Also look in documentation for any mention of testing or code coverage. Sometimes the README or a docs section will mention how to run tests or a coverage report. If the project uses continuous integration (CI) badges, you might see a badge for build passing or coverage percentage. If the repository is large, focus on whether test files exist and how many (e.g., compare number of test files to number of contract files). If no repository is available or no test folder, then likely this is a 0.

Scoring Criteria: This question is scored on a percentage scale depending on how thorough testing is. DeFiSafety uses the Test-to-Code ratio (TtC) and presence of different test types as a guide:

    100%: The testing is extremely thorough. Specifically, a TtC > 120% (i.e., more lines of test code than lines of contract code) is a strong indicator. Also, both unit tests and system/integration tests are present and visible in the repository. This implies every function and scenario is tested, and the tests likely cover more than 100% of the code (some lines tested by multiple tests).

    ~80%: Good testing in place. TtC > 80% (meaning tests cover at least 80% as many lines as code) and both unit and system tests are present. There might be minor gaps, but overall most of the code is tested.

    ~40%: Some tests exist but testing is not comprehensive. Perhaps TtC is below 80%, or only one type of testing is visible (e.g., only unit tests for some contracts). This suggests partial coverage – significant parts of the code might not be tested or the tests are few.

    0%: No evidence of tests. Either the repository has no test files, or the documentation explicitly states no tests were written. A 0 indicates that users cannot be confident the code was properly verified before deployment.

(If the project has a private repo and didn't publish tests, this would also be 0 because we can't see any tests. But generally, absence of public tests = assume no tests or not enough transparency about testing.)

Answer Format: The answer should describe what was found regarding tests and then give a percentage score:

    "The project's GitHub contains a comprehensive test suite (over 100 test files) covering all major contracts, and both unit and integration tests are present. This suggests a very high Test-to-Code ratio, likely above 100%. Score: 100%."

    If moderate: "There are a number of tests, but coverage is not complete – for example, only core functions have unit tests and some contracts have no tests. This appears to correspond to a partial Test-to-Code ratio (significantly under 100%). Score: ~40%."

    If none: "No test files or testing instructions were found in the repository, and the documentation does not mention any testing. Score: 0%."

When possible, cite evidence such as the presence of a /tests folder or a statement in docs about test coverage. If you find a code coverage report or badge, that can also be cited (though code coverage specifically is Q11 in the full process, here we incorporate it into the assessment of testing thoroughness). Always justify the score with how extensive the tests are.
