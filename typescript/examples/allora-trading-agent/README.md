- ðŸ¤– **Trading Analysis**: Analyze market conditions and provide actionable trading recommendations
- ðŸ’± **Trade Execution**: Execute token swaps across multiple chains via Ember
- ðŸ”„ **Workflow Automation**: Combined predict-analyze-trade workflows
- âš¡ **Multi-Chain Support**: Trade on Arbitrum, Ethereum, Base, Optimism, and Polygon

## Skills
