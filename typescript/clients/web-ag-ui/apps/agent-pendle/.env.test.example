# CI-safe defaults for integration/e2e tests.
# Copy this file to `.env.test` to override locally (file is gitignored).

# Optional: bypass delegation signing by using the agent wallet for execution.
DELEGATIONS_BYPASS=false

# Optional: onchain actions API URL used by the agent runtime.
# Defaults to https://api.emberai.xyz when unset.
# For tests we keep this pointed at a non-routable host that MSW intercepts.
ONCHAIN_ACTIONS_API_URL=http://onchain-actions.test
# Optional: point at the real API when recording mocks:
# ONCHAIN_ACTIONS_API_URL=https://api.emberai.xyz

# Optional: override the URL used by the mock recorder (defaults to https://api.emberai.xyz).
# ONCHAIN_ACTIONS_RECORDING_URL=https://api.emberai.xyz

# Optional: signing key used when tx execution mode resolves to `execute` (eg DELEGATIONS_BYPASS=true).
# Use a throwaway dev key with small funds; never commit real keys.

# Smoke scripts (manual, not CI):
# Keep smoke-only knobs out of `.env.test` so automated test runs remain CI-safe.
# See `apps/agent-pendle/.env.example` for the full list of smoke variables.

# E2E (LangGraph API)
# These tests require a running LangGraph server. Keep them disabled by default so
# `pnpm test` is CI-safe. To run locally:
# 1) start `pnpm dev` (LangGraph on :8125), then
# 2) copy this file to `.env.test` and uncomment the vars below.
# 3) set `PENDLE_E2E=true` to opt in.
# PENDLE_E2E=true
# LANGGRAPH_DEPLOYMENT_URL=http://localhost:8125
# LANGGRAPH_GRAPH_ID=agent-pendle
