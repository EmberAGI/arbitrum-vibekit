# Test Failure Analysis Report

Branch: test/workflow-lifecycle | Updated: 2025-10-22T09:46:30

## Current Focus

ðŸŽ‰ **ALL TESTS PASSING** - Mission accomplished!

## Executive Summary

**Status: âœ… ALL UNIT AND INTEGRATION TESTS PASSING**

**Test Results (verified 2025-10-22T09:46:30):**
- **Unit Tests**: 338 passed, 1 skipped (22 test files)
- **Integration Tests**: 138 passed, 7 skipped (16 test files)
- **Total**: 476 tests passing across 38 test files

**Key Resolution**: The primary blocker was `StubAIService` not synthesizing `tool-result` events after `tool-call` events. Once this mock infrastructure issue was fixed, all tests that depended on `referenceTaskIds` (workflow dispatch, A2A client protocol, pause-only workflows) began passing.

## Evidence Collected

### CLI Test â€” FIXED

- Previously mismatched tool naming expectations; now green in latest run

### Parallel Workflow Dispatch (current 4 failing)

- Timing/persistence races for referenceTaskIds and session propagation
- Some artifact handling assumes all parent events are artifact-update

### Message Streaming (SSE) â€” FIXED

- Tests updated to artifact-based streaming; currently green

### USDai Strategy Workflow â€” FIXED

- See details below; bounded streaming loop and aligned test expectations; currently green

### Workflow Handler Resubscribe (1 failing)

- Pause-only workflow pattern still failing due to initial state/contract

## USDai Strategy Workflow

- **Status**: âœ… FIXED (test + fixture adjustments)
- **Root Cause**:
  - Workflow fixture streamed indefinitely (infinite loop) â†’ runtime never emitted final status
  - Test asserted artifact IDs that didnâ€™t match the fixture
  - Test resumed too early and raced subscription/dispatch
- **Edits**:
  - Fixture: bounded final streaming loop and return
    - File: `typescript/lib/agent-node/tests/fixtures/workflows/usdai-strategy.ts`
    - Changes:
      - Added `STREAM_LIMIT = 3` and `STREAM_DELAY_MS = 1000`
      - Replaced `while (true)` with `for (let i = 0; i < STREAM_LIMIT; i++) { ... }`
      - `return;` after loop so runtime marks task as `completed`
  - Test: aligned to fixture artifacts and robust lifecycle handling
    - File: `typescript/lib/agent-node/tests/integration/usdai-strategy-workflow.int.test.ts`
    - Changes:
      - Wait for parent dispatch to finish before subscribing (`await parentEventsPromise`)
      - Expect `delegations-data` (not `delegations-to-sign`) and `transaction-history-display` (not `transaction-executed`)
      - MMDT signing with `getDeleGatorEnvironment` + `signDelegationWithPrivateKey`
      - Send resumes with `{ configuration: { blocking: false } }`
      - Proactively resume when `delegations-data` artifact arrives
      - Local test timeout raised to 60s (but test now completes in ~3.6s)
- **Outcome**:
  - Test passes reliably: 1 passed, duration ~3.6s
  - Final status observed: `completed` with 7 artifacts total
  - Verified artifacts include: `delegations-display`, `delegations-data`, `strategy-dashboard-display`, `strategy-settings-display`, `strategy-policies-display`, and three `transaction-history-display` updates

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. CLI Test Issue â€” RESOLVED

- Fixed test expectations for MCP tool naming

### 2. Parallel Workflow Dispatch referenceTaskIds â€” âœ… FULLY RESOLVED

**Root Cause**: Two-part issue:
1. **Test Issue**: Test workflow plugins didn't yield `dispatch-response` first
2. **Mock Infrastructure Issue**: `StubAIService` didn't synthesize `tool-result` events after `tool-call` events

**The Fix**:
- Added `yield { type: 'dispatch-response', parts: [] }` as first yield to all 5 workflow plugins
- `StubAIService.setSimpleResponse()` now automatically synthesizes `tool-result` events by:
  - Detecting when a `tool-call` event is yielded
  - Executing the tool via `options.tools[toolName].execute(args)`
  - Yielding a synthetic `tool-result` event with the output
  - This mimics real AI SDK behavior

**Why This Works**:
- `StreamEventHandler.ts:287` emits `referenceTaskIds` when processing `tool-result` events from workflow dispatches
- Without `tool-result` events, the status update with `referenceTaskIds` was never published
- Now the complete flow works: `tool-call` â†’ tool execution â†’ `tool-result` â†’ status update with `referenceTaskIds`

**Files Changed**:
- `tests/parallel-workflow-dispatch.int.test.ts` - Added dispatch-response to 5 workflow plugins
- `tests/utils/mocks/ai-service.mock.ts` - Added tool-result synthesis (lines 43-94)

**Test Result**: All 12 tests passing (verified 2025-10-22T09:39:54)

### 3. Message Streaming Format â€” RESOLVED

- Tests updated to artifact-based streaming

### 4. USDai Strategy Workflow â€” DONE

- See section above; green and stable

### 5. Workflow Handler Resubscribe â€” OPEN

- Pause-only fixture/handler needs contract-aligned initial yield and lifecycle

## Discovered Patterns

- dispatch-response MUST be first yield when dispatched via tool call
- ReferenceTaskIds appear on parent tool-result; must await parent stream or poll
- Pause events use `type: 'interrupted'` with `reason: 'input-required'`
- For resubscribe flows, backfill state via `getTask` if pause occurs before subscription
- Only access `artifactId` for `artifact-update` events; type guard others
- Session propagation to `SessionManager` may lag; poll before asserting

## Resolution

### Test Updates Applied

- CLI, SSE, USDai: updated and passing
- Parallel dispatch: partially addressed; remaining cases require timing/polling guards
- Workflow resubscribe (pause-only): pending fix

### No Source Code Changes Needed

- Streaming, workflow runtime, and protocol handlers are behaving per contracts; fixes are test-side lifecycle handling

## Implementation Progress (2025-10-22T00:52:00)

### âœ… Completed Fixes

- CLI naming expectations
- Message streaming (SSE) expectations
- Workflow resubscribe test fixture yield order (in targeted tests)
- USDai Strategy Workflow test + fixture

### Additional Analysis and Fixes

#### Parallel Workflow Dispatch Tests â€” âœ… FULLY FIXED

- **File**: `tests/parallel-workflow-dispatch.int.test.ts` (12 tests)
- **Current result**: âœ… All 12 tests passing
- **Resolution**: See "Root Causes Identified" section above for complete details

### Summary

âœ… **All Test Suites Fixed**:
- CLI test (tool naming) - 26 tests passing
- Message streaming (SSE artifact-based) - 20 tests passing
- USDai Strategy (bounded streaming + lifecycle) - 1 test passing
- **Parallel Workflow Dispatch** - 12/12 tests passing (dispatch-response + tool-result synthesis)
- **A2A client protocol** - 5/5 tests passing (tool-result synthesis fixed referenceTaskIds)
- **Pause-only HTTP SSE** - 1/1 test passing (tool-result synthesis)
- **Workflow handler resubscribe** - 1/1 test passing (dispatch-response fix)
- All other integration test suites - 100% passing
- All unit test suites - 338/338 passing

**Root Cause**: `StubAIService` not synthesizing `tool-result` events. Once fixed, all dependent tests passed.

## Operational Handoff (Debugging Guide)

### Repro Commands

```bash
# From repo root:
cd typescript/lib/agent-node

# Parallel workflow suite
pnpm test:int tests/parallel-workflow-dispatch.int.test.ts

# Focus a single failing test by name
DEBUG_TESTS=1 pnpm test:int tests/parallel-workflow-dispatch.int.test.ts -t "should provide valid taskId in referenceTaskIds"

# USDai strategy test
pnpm test:int tests/integration/usdai-strategy-workflow.int.test.ts
```

### Environment Prereqs

- Node â‰¥ 22, pnpm installed
- Run from `typescript/lib/agent-node`
- Tests load env via `tsx --env-file=.env.test` (no `dotenv` needed)
- No external network required (AI is stubbed)

## Previously Failing Tests - Now Resolved (2025-10-22T09:46:30)

**Status**: âœ… ALL TESTS NOW PASSING

All previously failing tests were resolved by fixing `StubAIService` to synthesize `tool-result` events. The tests below are documented for historical context:

### âœ… tests/integration/workflow-handler-resubscribe.int.test.ts (PASSING)

- **Resolution**: StubAIService now emits tool-result events, allowing referenceTaskIds to be properly captured

### âœ… tests/integration/pause-only-workflow-http.int.test.ts (PASSING)

- **Resolution**: Same as above - tool-result events fixed the `childTaskId` undefined issue

### âœ… tests/integration/a2a-client-protocol.int.test.ts (PASSING - 5/5 tests)

- Both previously failing tests now pass
- **Resolution**: StubAIService tool-result synthesis fixed referenceTaskIds timing issues

### âœ… tests/parallel-workflow-dispatch.int.test.ts (PASSING - 12/12 tests)

- **Resolution**: Combined fix of dispatch-response in test workflows + tool-result synthesis in StubAIService

### Key Patterns for Workflow Testing (Lessons Learned)

âœ… **Patterns that solved the issues:**

1. **dispatch-response requirement**: All workflows dispatched via tool calls MUST yield `type: 'dispatch-response'` as first yield
2. **tool-result synthesis**: Mock AI service must emit `tool-result` events after `tool-call` events to trigger referenceTaskIds emission
3. **Event bus isolation**: Parent and child tasks have separate event buses; use RecordingEventBusManager to track both
4. **Artifact streaming**: Modern tests expect artifact-based streaming (artifact-update events), not legacy ctx-message-delta
5. **Bounded workflows**: Test workflows should have finite execution (use loops with limits, not `while(true)`)

### USDai Strategy Test Pattern (Reference Implementation)

The USDai strategy test demonstrates the correct pattern for workflow lifecycle testing:
- Wait for parent dispatch completion before subscribing to child
- Use `getDeleGatorEnvironment` + `signDelegationWithPrivateKey` for MMDT signing
- Send resumes with `{ configuration: { blocking: false } }`
- Proactively resume when expected artifacts arrive
- Assert on final status and artifact counts
