# Project: Arbitrum Vibekit - Keep feature branch up to date with main

Last Updated: 2025-09-20T09:31:52+07:00
Current Role: Executor

## Background and Motivation

Update the repository at `<home directory>/CascadeProjects/arbitrum-vibekit` on branch `main` with the latest from remote, then bring those changes into the worktree branch `arbitrum-vibekit-para` located at `<home directory>/CascadeProjects/arbitrum-vibekit-para` via rebase (preferred) or merge.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- Multi-worktree setup: root worktree at `arbitrum-vibekit/` with branch `main`, additional worktree at `arbitrum-vibekit-para/` with branch `arbitrum-vibekit-para`.
- Untracked files in `arbitrum-vibekit-para` initially:
  - `.kilocode/workflows/auto-commit-pull.md`
  - `.kilocode/workflows/auto-commit-push-only.md`
  - `.windsurf/workflows/auto-commit-pull.md`
  - `.windsurf/workflows/auto-commit-push-only.md`
- `typescript/pnpm-lock.yaml` had the skip-worktree flag set, hiding a local modification and blocking rebase. Cleared the flag and will stash the tracked change to proceed cleanly.
- Prefer linear history â†’ rebase `arbitrum-vibekit-para` onto `origin/main`.

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Update `main` worktree
- Description: Fetch/prune remotes and fast-forward pull `origin/main` in `<home directory>/CascadeProjects/arbitrum-vibekit`.
- Success Criteria: `git rev-parse HEAD` equals `origin/main` and no local changes.
- Dependencies: Network access to remote.
- Status: Completed

### Task 2: Prepare `arbitrum-vibekit-para` for rebase
- Description: Stash untracked files and any tracked hidden changes to avoid rebase interruptions.
- Success Criteria: `git status` clean (no untracked/unstaged changes).
- Dependencies: Task 1
- Status: Completed

### Task 3: Rebase `arbitrum-vibekit-para` onto `origin/main`
- Description: `git fetch origin` then `git rebase origin/main` from `<home directory>/CascadeProjects/arbitrum-vibekit-para`.
- Success Criteria: Rebase completes without conflicts or all conflicts resolved; branch points to new base.
- Dependencies: Task 2
- Status: Completed

### Task 4: Post-rebase cleanup
- Description: Decide whether to apply stashed untracked/tracked files; re-apply and commit if desired.
- Success Criteria: Working tree in desired state; CI/lint passes.
- Dependencies: Task 3
- Status: Not Started

### Task 5: Push updates
- Description: Push `arbitrum-vibekit-para` to remote (if remote branch exists and we want to update it).
- Success Criteria: Remote reflects updated history.
- Dependencies: Task 4
- Status: Not Started

## Project Status Board

- [x] Task 0: Verify branches and cleanliness in both worktrees
- [x] Task 1: Update `main` worktree
- [x] Task 2: Stash untracked + tracked changes in `arbitrum-vibekit-para`
- [x] Task 3: Rebase `arbitrum-vibekit-para` onto `origin/main`
- [ ] Task 4: Restore/commit stashed files as needed
- [ ] Task 5: Push updated branch (optional)

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

- 2025-09-20T09:31:52+07:00: Detected `main` at `<home directory>/CascadeProjects/arbitrum-vibekit` (clean). Detected `arbitrum-vibekit-para` at `<home directory>/CascadeProjects/arbitrum-vibekit-para` with 4 untracked files listed above.
- 2025-09-20T09:31:52+07:00: Updated `main` via fast-forward to `origin/main` in `<home directory>/CascadeProjects/arbitrum-vibekit`.
- 2025-09-20T09:31:52+07:00: Stashed untracked files in `arbitrum-vibekit-para`; discovered `typescript/pnpm-lock.yaml` had skip-worktree flag masking local changes. Cleared flag and plan to stash the tracked change before rebase.
- 2025-09-20T09:31:52+07:00: Stashed tracked change for `typescript/pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- 2025-09-20T09:31:52+07:00: Successfully rebased `arbitrum-vibekit-para` onto `origin/main`. HEAD at `f07360f`, ahead of `origin/main` by 2 commits. Stashes present: `stash@{0}` (lockfile), `stash@{1}` (untracked workflows).

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- Default approach is rebase for a linear history. If you prefer merge instead, please say so.
- Decide whether to keep and commit the local lockfile change after rebase; likely better to discard in favor of `main`'s lockfile.

## Lessons Learned

- Issue: Rebase can be blocked by untracked files or skip-worktree-masked changes.
  Solution: `git stash push -u` for untracked; `git update-index --no-skip-worktree` then stash tracked changes.

## Rationale Log

- Decision: Use fast-forward-only pull on `main`.
  Rationale: Prevent accidental merge commits in `main`.
  Trade-offs: Requires remote to be ahead and compatible with FF.
  Date: 2025-09-20

- Decision: Prefer rebase over merge for updating `arbitrum-vibekit-para`.
  Rationale: Keeps linear, readable history and simplifies future rebases.
  Trade-offs: Rewrites local history; requires force-push if branch is published.
